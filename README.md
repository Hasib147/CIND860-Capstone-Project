# CIND860-Capstone-Project
This repository includes all the files from CIND860 Capstone Project course taken at TMU during the Fall 2023 term.

This is my very large file for my Fashion MNIST Train dataset(the test dataset is already attached in the main repository):

For the Iniital Results & code part of the project, the top 20 pixels were used based on the Random Forest Importance (RFI) Embedded technique on the test dataset.
This was used as the system crashed if too much memory was consumed (from using the top 5-10% of the overall test dataset), so only top 20 were considered.
The .html of the pandaprofiling report will be updated and posted on this repository along with the source code in .ipynb format (done on Google colab).
